# 1. Removed
# When a data container is removed. Monitor will reject if we create a new one. So:
# - From monitor, run "pg_autoctl drop node --name {NAME} --force"
# - Run new container. Then monitor will accept it. We can reuse the mounted volumes.

2. When monitor stop, start it again.
3. When any data node stop, start it again.
4. When all data nodes stop, we have to remove all data node and recreate them again.
5. When all nodes of a group stop, we have to remove and recreate them again.
