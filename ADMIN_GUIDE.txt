# 1. DEPRECATED
# When a data container is removed. Monitor will reject if we create a new one. So:
# - From monitor, run "pg_autoctl drop node --name {NAME} --force"
# - Run new container. Then monitor will accept it. We can reuse the mounted volumes.

2. When monitor stop, start it again.
3. When any data node stop, start it again.

# 4. DEPRECATED
# When all data nodes stop, we have to remove all data node and recreate them again.

# 5. DEPRECATED
# When all nodes of a group stop, we have to remove and recreate them again.

6. Check whether a node is primary(read-write) or secondary(read-only) by SQL: 
SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();
"true" means that node is secondary (in standby mode).
"false" means that node is primary or single. 

7. Data nodes have no password. Monitor node has password which is "postgres / postgres".

8. If a primary cannot communicate to the monitor it starts checking whether the secondary is 
still connected. In PostgreSQL, the secondary connection automatically times out after 30 seconds. 
If last contact with the monitor and the last time a connection from the secondary was observed are 
both more than 30 seconds in the past, the primary concludes it is on the losing side of a network 
partition and shuts itself down.

9. When monitor is removed, create it again.
10. When any data node removed, create it again.
